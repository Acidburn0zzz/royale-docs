# Development tools

You can just use any standard text editor to write Royale applications and the command-line to compile them, but you may find that an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) can make you even more productive.

## IDEs
IDEs that support Apache Royale provide getting-started instructions to help you specify using Royale for a new project, or importing an existing Royale project.

### IDEs with Royale support

- [Visual Studio Code with ActionScript and MXML Extensions](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-nextgenas/wiki/Install-the-ActionScript-and-MXML-extension-for-Visual-Studio-Code){:target='_blank'}

- [Moonshine](http://moonshine-ide.com){:target='_blank'}

### IDES that supported Flex and work with Royale with some restrictions and limitations.

- Adobe Flash Builder

- IntelliJ IDEA

- FDT

- Flash Develop

## Command-line scripts

To run the compiler, run the js/bin/mxmlc tool in the Royale SDK. The [Download Royale](Get_Started/Download-Royale.html) and [Hello World](Get_Started/Hello-World.html) sections provide guidance about how to use the compiler.

Royale provides [Royale CLI](Get_Started/Royale-CLI.html), a tool to simplify creating and compiling applications for those using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a>.

## Apache Maven

You can use Apache Maven to compile your Royale application. Visit the [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org){:target='_blank'} to learn more about Maven. Each of the examples in the examples folder is set up to be built with Maven, and the archetypes folder contains Maven Archetypes.

## Apache Ant

You can use Apache Ant to compile your Royale application. Visit the [Apache Ant Project](https://ant.apache.org){:target='_blank'} to learn more about Ant. Each of the examples in the examples folder is set up to be built with Ant.

## Apache Cordova

Apache Cordova enables Royale applications to run on mobile devices, tablets, and even desktops.  The MobileTrader example in examples/royale/MobileTrader and a few other examples use Cordova. Visit the <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Cordova project</a> to learn more about using Cordova.
