Pre-written sets of code which allows for easier development of Royale-based applications.

we'll be listing here the available Royale libraries.

## Frameworks
_Information coming soon_

## Libraries

### Part of Apache Royale:

* [Crux](libraries/crux) An library based on Swiz. Swiz is a framework that simplifies applications and gives you Inversion of Control/Dependency Injection, Event handling, new Metadatas, simplified life cycle for asynchronous remote method invocations and many more.

### Third party (external libraries)

* [PureMVC](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-multicore-framework/wiki){:target='_blank'} is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic Model-View-Controller design meta-pattern. Is part of [The PureMVC Framework](https://puremvc.org){:target='_blank'} that implements the same library in many other popular languages and technologies.
