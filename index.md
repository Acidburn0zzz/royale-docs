Apache Royale is the new SDK, built on the solid foundation developed by the Flex universe, that lets you create applications in MXML and ActionScript that will run almost anywhere without heavy plugins like Flash or Adobe AIR.

With Royale, you can create a single code base that can be compiled to work like a native app on Windows or Apple systems, on Android phones, on tablets of all systems and sizes, or on embedded JavaScript environments like Chromium Embedded Framework. 

This is the main documentation for Apache Royale.  If you are looking for the API Reference, [click here](http://royale.apache.org/asdoc/index.html){:target='_blank'}.

This document is divided into several sections:

 * [High Level View](welcome/high-level-view.html) gives an overview of Royale.

 * [Features and Concepts](features-and-concepts.html) explains the main features of Royale and some concepts that might help you be more productive.

 * [A Bit of History](welcome/history.html) provides a brief background on how Royale came to be.

 * [Licenses and Policies](welcome/licenses.html) contains the fine print.

 * [Get Involved](welcome/get-involved.html) explains how you can contribute to the future of Royale.
