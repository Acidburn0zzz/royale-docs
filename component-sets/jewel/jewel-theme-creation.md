# Jewel Theme Creation

How to make a new Theme for Jewel

Jewel is a component set designed with change of appearance in mind. Jewel comes with a series of pre designed themes so it can be used directly without the need for the user to create their own appearance. You can know more about those themes [here](component-sets/jewel/jewel-themes.html). The Jewel Themes that comes with Apache Royale define 12 colors, dark and light, flat / no-flat visuals. However, on many occasions users will want a personalized look, either adapting one of the themes that come with the distribution or creating their own from scratch.

## Theme Basics

Themes are a combination of files that define styles in [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets){:target='_blank'} and other assets like images (JPG, PNG, SVG,...). In Jewel we use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com){:target='_blank'} to define the CSS style rules since is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.

> Note that you can create your own theme without the need of SASS, since is not obligatory, but we strongly recommend to use it for the same reason you use AS3 instead of plain javascript

One of the advantages of using SASS is that we can organize style definitions by separating styles into files. In Jewel we use a `.sass` file per component so that in that file we will find all the definitions of that component.

## Generation of default.css file

`default.css` file is the resultant CSS file that compile and holds all CSS definitions for Jewel. This file is generated by __SASS__ compiler. When the library is compiled we use __SASS__ to generate 'src/main/resuorces/default.css` file as part of the build process.

> Notice that SASS generation actually is only set up in Maven build, but not in ANT. Apache Royale generates all default.css files in the SDK and make them available to users using ANT. In the future we expect contributors add SASS generation for ANT.

### Jewel Library

Here you'll find the ActionScript classes that define each component and many other support class files each component need in order to work properly. You'll find a `sass` folder with a `.sass` file per component where all "structural" definitions are defined. Those definitions can be normal _CSS rules_ or _royale bead definition rules_.

By design, you'll never find any style rule in __Jewel library__ that define _colors, lines, fonts, or shapes_. We'll find only the CSS rules that is needed to generate each Jewel component visual structure (i.e: display, position, z-index, overflow,...), and the default ActionScript bead classes that ship with a concrete component per platform (i.e: BeadView, BeadModel, BeadController, BeadLayout,...)

### Jewel Theme Library

This library is like a __Master Theme__ where _colors, fonts, icons or shapes_ are defined and is the library from wich the rest of Jewel theme variants are generated thanks to SASS preprocess power. Each Jewel Theme in Royale use the definitions in Jewel Theme library and just change a few variables to generate the variants.

### Primary, Secondary and Emphasized colors

Since Jewel Themes support 3 diferent colors __Primary__, __Secondary__ and __Emphasized__, then the __Jewel Theme Library__ folder structure is the following:

* For __Primary__ color: `sass/components-primary`
* For __Secondary__ color: `sass/components-secondary`
* For __Emphasized__ color: `sass/components-empahsized`

`primary` folder holds primary and default colors and is used by most of the components in Jewel, while `secondary` and `emphasized` folder is only used for some of them (i.e: Button, Badge or SnackBar).

### Theme SASS file

`_theme.sass` is the SASS file where we can make Jewel Themes take significant visual changes. It's a very simple configuration file with 5 variables that SASS will use when we want to generate `default.css` file.

This is essentialy what each of the jewel themes that comes with Apache Royale defines in a different way.

For example, by default, we can find:

```sass
//Theme variables (Flat/No Flat - Dark/Light - Primary/Secondary/Emphasized Color
$flat: false
$dark: false
$primary-color: $blue
$secondary-color: $topaz
$emphasized-color: $emerald
```

## Jewel Theme Summary

So, in summary, __Jewel library__ has defintions that normally users does not need to change, while __Jewel Theme library__ is like a master theme for all royale jewel themes and a good starting point to create a new user define jewel theme or just modify one of the ones that comes with the royale distribution.

> A user should just need to duplicate Jewel Theme library to start modify each style per jewel component.

## Looking to a concrete jewel component as an example

Lets take [Jewel Alert](component-sets/jewel/jewel-alert.html) component as an example to help us to visualize the different files that compose this concrete component:

In __Jewel library__ you can find:

* [org.apache.royale.jewel.Alert](https://royale.apache.org/asdoc/index.html#!org.apache.royale.jewel/Alert){:target='_blank'}: This is the main __Alert__ component file
* `sass/components/_alert.sass`: This is the main __Alert__ SASS definition that holds all structural CSS rules and the default beads for Alert. The beads defined here for Javascript platform are:

```sass 
j|Alert
    IBeadLayout: ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.layouts.NullLayout")
    IBeadModel: ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.models.AlertModel")
    IBeadController: ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.controllers.AlertController")
    IBeadView:  ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.views.AlertView")
```

So __Alert__ is composed by four Actionscript files and one `.sass` files that wire the component with its beads and setup a set of CSS rules to give a concrete CSS structrure, but does not define colors, gradients, shapes or icons for Alert. All of this will be found in the theme.

In __Jewel Theme library__ you can find:

* `sass/components-primary/_alert.sass`: This is the main __Alert__ SASS theme definition that holds all theme CSS rules. Here you can find colors, gradients, line styles and other visual things that will affect how the __Alert__ component is presented to the user.

This component doesn't define any `secondary` or `emphasized` color.
