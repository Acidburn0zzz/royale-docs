# Jewel Theme Creation

How to make a new theme for Jewel

Jewel is a component set designed with change of appearance in mind. Jewel comes with a series of pre-designed themes so you can use it right away without having to create your own theme. You can learn more about the existing themes [here](component-sets/jewel/jewel-themes.html). The Jewel themes that come with Apache Royale define 12 colors, dark and light, flat / no-flat visuals. However, you may want a personalized look, and you can either adapt one of the existing themes or create one from scratch.

## Theme basics

Themes are a combination of files that define styles in [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets){:target='_blank'} and other assets like images (JPG, PNG, SVG,...). In Jewel we use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com){:target='_blank'} to define the CSS style rules since is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.

> You can create your own theme without the need of SASS, since is not obligatory, but we strongly recommend using it for the same reason we use AS3 instead of plain JavaScript.

One of the advantages of using SASS is that we can organize style definitions by separating styles into files. In Jewel we use a `.sass` file per component so we can easily find all the definitions of the style's components.

## Generating default.css

The `default.css` file is the resuling CSS file that holds all CSS definitions for a Jewel theme. This file is generated by the SASS compiler. When a library with styles in it is compiled we use SASS to generate the `src/main/resuorces/default.css` file as part of the build process.

> SASS generation is only set up in the Maven build, not in the ANT build. Apache Royale generates all `default.css` files in the SDK and makes them available to users using ANT, other build tools or IDEs. In the future we expect contributors to add SASS generation for ANT.

## Jewel Library

Here you'll find the [ActionScript](features/as3.html) classes that define each component and support class files components need to work properly. You'll find a `sass` folder with a `.sass` file for each component which holds all _structural_ definitions. Those definitions can be normal _CSS rules_ or _royale bead definition rules_.

You'll never find a style rule in the Jewel library that define _colors, lines, fonts, or shapes_ (the theme we locate in the __theme library__ handles these values). We'll find only the CSS rules needed to generate each jewel component visual structure (i.e: display, position, z-index, overflow,...), and the default ActionScript bead classes that ship with a concrete component per platform (i.e: BeadView, BeadModel, BeadController, BeadLayout,...).

> Apache Royale uses CSS through all the framwework to link [beads to the component's strand](features/strands-and-beads.html) so components define the default composition of beads via CSS.

## Jewel Theme Library

This library is like a __master theme__ where _colors, fonts, icons or shapes_ are defined, and is the library which generates Jewel theme variants, thanks to SASS preprocessing power. Each Jewel theme in Apache Royale uses the definitions in this library and [just changes a few variables to generate the variants](component-sets/jewel/jewel-theme-creation.html#theme-sass-file).

## Primary, Secondary and Emphasized colors

Since Jewel themes support three diferent colors (__Primary__, __Secondary__ and __Emphasized__),  the Jewel Theme Library folder structure is:

* __Primary__ color: `sass/components-primary` for styles that use primary and default colors.
* __Secondary__ color: `sass/components-secondary` for styles that use secondary colors.
* __Emphasized__ color: `sass/components-empahsized` for styles that use emphasized colors.

`primary` is used by most of the components in Jewel, while only a few (i.e: Button, Badge or SnackBar) that need these variants use `secondary` and `emphasized`.

## Theme SASS file

`sass/_theme.sass` is the SASS file where we can modify Jewel themes. It's a very simple configuration file with variables that SASS uses to generate a `default.css` file. This is essentialy how each of the Jewel themes that come with Apache Royale are defined.

For example, by default, we can find:

```sass
//Theme variables (Flat/No Flat - Dark/Light - Primary/Secondary/Emphasized Color
$flat: false
$dark: false
$primary-color: $blue
$secondary-color: $topaz
$emphasized-color: $emerald
```

so this `_theme.sass` file will create a Jewel theme variant that will look _no-flat_ and _light_, with _blue as the primary color_, _topaz as the secondary color_ and _emerald as the emphasized color_.

## Jewel Theme summary

__Jewel library__ has defintions that you don't normally need to change, while __Jewel Theme library__ is like a __master theme__ for all Royale Jjewel themes and is a good starting point when you want to create a new Jewel theme or just modify an existing one.

> To modify a style, make a copy of the __Jewel Theme Library__ and start adjusting the style for each Jewel component.

## A Jewel component example

Let's take the [Jewel Alert](component-sets/jewel/jewel-alert.html) component as an example and look at the different files that compose this component:

In __Jewel library__ you can find:

* [org.apache.royale.jewel.Alert](https://royale.apache.org/asdoc/index.html#!org.apache.royale.jewel/Alert){:target='_blank'}: This is the main __Alert__ component file.
* `sass/components/_alert.sass`: This is the main definition file that holds all structural CSS rules and the default beads for Alert. The beads defined here for the JavaScript platform are:

```sass 
j|Alert
    IBeadLayout: ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.layouts.NullLayout")
    IBeadModel: ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.models.AlertModel")
    IBeadController: ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.controllers.AlertController")
    IBeadView:  ClassReference("org.apache.royale.jewel.beads.views.AlertView")
```

Regarding the CSS selectors for Alert: The main `.as` file (in this case `Alert.as`) assigns a css selector to the `typeNames` variable:

```as3
    typeNames = "jewel alert";
```

In the `sass` file you find the corresponding CSS selector:

```sass
    .jewel.alert
```

Nested in that selector is the corresponding tree of rules and selectors for that component.

So __Alert__ is composed of four ActionScript files, and one `.sass` file that wires the component with its beads and defines a set of CSS rules to give a concrete CSS structure, but does not define colors, gradients, shapes or icons for Alert. The theme does all of that.

In __Jewel Theme library__ you can find:

* `sass/components-primary/_alert.sass`: This is the main __Alert__ SASS definition that holds all theme CSS rules. Here you can define colors, gradients, line styles and other visual features that affect how the __Alert__ component appears to the user. All styles are in a `.jewel.alert` CSS selector.

As you can see, the `Alert` component doesn't define any `secondary` or `emphasized` color.
