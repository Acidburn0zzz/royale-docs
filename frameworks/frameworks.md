# Frameworks

Structures to simplify development and delivery

Frameworks are software libraries that structure and simplify repeated software development tasks and processes to make it easier to develop, maintain, and deliver effective applications that perform reliably and efficiently. Developers using Adobe and Apache Flex benefitted from a number of frameworks, including:

- Tide, part of the Granite Data Services platform.
- Swiz
- Parsley
- Cairngorm
- PureMVC
- DropAS3
- Fabrication
- Mate
- RobotLegs

The first Royale framework in development is *Crux*, based on Swiz for Flex. It proposes to provide:

- Inversion of Control (IOC) / Dependency Injection (DI) with metadata
- Event handling (metadata)
- Simple life cycle for asynchronous remote method invocations
- Decoupling from application code

Documentation for Crux will be available soon.
