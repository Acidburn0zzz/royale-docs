<!-- What sort of hardware will support work in Royale -->
# System requirements

Apache Royale is designed for use on Mac or PC computers, but not (yet) on Linux.

Since developers normally use Royale in the IDE of their choice, the system needs to satisfy the minimum requirements for that IDE. You do not need Internet access to work with Royale unless that is required by the IDE you are using.

If you are compiling strictly by command-line...

Royale requires Java SDK 1.7 or greater to be installed on your computer. You can access the latest Java SDK from DOWNLOAD URL.
