# High Level View

Apache Royale began as "FlexJS", a branch of the Apache Flex project. The goal was to make a way for the many existing Flex applications users have developed to be deployable outside of the Adobe Flash and Adobe AIR enviromments.

While Flex may work using Flash in browsers or within AIR on computers with traditional keyboards for years to come, Flex developers need to make their apps available on mobile devices, which for many end users are now the primary computer. The cost of migrating an application to a new coding language is high, and the risks around quality control are significant, especially when migrating to a less-strict language like JavaScript. Royale helps to minimize the cost and the risk of migration, while reusing much of the Flex code base without significant changes.

Beyond that, it is becoming clear that Royale can provide significant developer productivity gains for new projects. Flex made it easy and efficient to create robust applications. Like Flex, Royale provides:

- Declarative Language (MXML) - Declarative languages provide a schematic, or diagram. of the pieces of the application, and are more terse than options like JavaScript.
- Semi-Structured Language (ActionScript) - ActionScript deploys classes and interfaces, so it can do a better job of enforcing correct use of APIs than JavaScript can.
- Runtime Verifier - The verifier catches errors at runtime so you can address them before packaging a release.
- Choice of IDEs -  You can choose the IDE that suits you best, and the IDEs can provide better code assistance because the coding language is structured.

These features help you make fewer mistakes when writing code, and that saves time and improves productivity.

## How it works
*This material will be added soon.*

## Status
Adobe Royale 0.9.0 was released in January, 2018. It is roughly of beta quality. The latest release is always available on the *Download* tab of this site.

Our project does not have a roadmap. As with most Apache projects, Royale is largely staffed by devoted volunteers. Rather than having a project owner who directs development, contributors come to agreement as a group about what they will work on next. Decisions are based on a combination of contributor skills and interests, and feature requests we receive from both Apache Flex and Royale users.

*Hint: the best way to move Royale forward is to join in and help!*
