# Node.js and Apache Royale

Compile ActionScript code to JavaScript and run on Node.js

There are two main approaches to targeting the popular [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime with Apache Royale and the [ActionScript](features/as3) language.

[Command line scripting](features/nodejs/scripting) explains how to call Node.js APIs from ActionScript, compile to JavaScript, and run the generated script from the command line.

[Node.js modules](features/nodejs/modules) explains how to compile a Node.js module with ActionScript that can be loaded with `require()` and deployed to npm.
