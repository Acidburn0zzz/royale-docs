# Data binding

Update the UI in real time as data changes

Royale, like Flex before it, makes it easy to pass data around your application. A change to data can automatically update the display of that data in the user interface, and potentially in calculations or other functions that use that data. The feature that makes this possible without having to write lots of code is *data binding*.

There are several ways to deploy data binding:

* [Using curly braces](features/data-binding.html#Using-curly-braces)
* [Using data binding in MXML](features/data-binding.html#mxml)
* [Using data binding in ActionScript](features/data-binding.html#Using-data-binding-in-ActionScript)
