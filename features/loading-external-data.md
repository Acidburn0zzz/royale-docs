# Loading External Data

Dynamic sites and real-time updates lead to good user experiences

Unless you are building a brochure-style website that makes a statement and provides contact information, you are going to be working with _data_. You will get some of that data from your site or application users, but you will probably also get a lot from outside your app or website.

Royale provides reliable, fast, and secure ways to get data from remote sources, and also to send data when you need to:

* [JSON](features/loading-external-data/json)
* [LocalSharedObject](features/loading-external-data/localsharedobject)
* [HTTPService](features/loading-external-data/httpservice)
* [RemoteObject](features/loading-external-data/remoteobject)
