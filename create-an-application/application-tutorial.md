# Tutorial - GitHub Commit Log Application

This tutorial will take you through building an app that displays the commit logs for the Royale project by connecting to the GitHub servers.

The first six segments will result in a functional application.

[The Main Application File](create-an-application/application-tutorial/main.html) This segment starts filling in the main application file.

[Data Model](create-an-application/application-tutorial/data.html)  This segment adds the code that manages the data in the application, including network access to GitHub.

[View (User Interface)](create-an-application/application-tutorial/view.html)  This segment builds out the initial user interface.

[Controller](create-an-application/application-tutorial/controller.html)  This segment hooks up the user interface to code that responds to the user's interactions.'

[Build](create-an-application/application-tutorial/build.html)  This segment gets the code to compile.

[Deploy](create-an-application/application-tutorial/deploy.html)  This segment discusses how to view the results.

The next four segments will discuss further improvements needed to make a production-ready version.

[Debugging](create-an-application/application-tutorial/debug.html)  This segment introduces a couple of techniques for figuring out why your app isn't working as expected.'

[Security](create-an-application/application-tutorial/security.html)  This segment discusses how to deal with network access to other domains.

[Production](create-an-application/application-tutorial/production.html)  This segment discusses the differences between a development version and a production version of an app.

[Value Objects](create-an-application/application-tutorial/value-objects.html)  This segment explains how Value Object (Data Classes) are useful in development and production.

The remaining segments will discuss further improvements needed to add additional common functionality.

[Localization](create-an-application/application-tutorial/locales.html)  This segment adds the ability to show the user-interface prompts in different languages.

[Filters](create-an-application/application-tutorial/filters.html)  This segment adds the ability to filter what commits are shown.

[Local Storage](create-an-application/application-tutorial/local-storage.html)  This segment shows how to store information in a cookie or equivalent in order to retain some of the state of the app between runs.

[Routing](create-an-application/application-tutorial/routing.html)  This segment shows how to map URL parameters to different initial values in the application and vice versa.
