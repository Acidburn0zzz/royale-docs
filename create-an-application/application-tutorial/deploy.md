# Run the application

Assuming you followed the typical directory and file pattern, and the MXML file was in a "src" directory, next to the "src" directory should be a "bin" directory and in it is a "js-debug" directory.

Inside the "js-debug" directory is an index.html.  You can open it in your browser and you should see the list of commits appear.

Or maybe the commits won't appear.  In fact, many browsers will not run this app successfully.  Let's figure out why.
