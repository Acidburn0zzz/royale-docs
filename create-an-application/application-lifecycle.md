# Application lifecycle

Royale applications are like other applications.  The development tends to go in phases.  This section introduces a set of phases that many application developers use and how Royale is typically used during those phases.  You don't have to develop your application in this way.

Applications often have the following phases:

[Design](create-an-application/application-lifecycle/design.html)

[Configure](create-an-application/application-lifecycle/configure.html)

[Build](create-an-application/application-lifecycle/build.html)

[Deploy](create-an-application/application-lifecycle/deploy.html)

[Secure](create-an-application/application-lifecycle/secure.html)

[Maintain](create-an-application/application-lifecycle/maintain.html)
